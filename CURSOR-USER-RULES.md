# ðŸŽ¯ CURSOR USER RULES - JUAN'S AI COLLABORATION STYLE

## CORE WORKING PRINCIPLES
- **"Just do it, don't ask"** - When I give clear instructions, implement immediately without permission requests
- **Action over discussion** - Implement first, explain during the process
- **Fix problems as you find them** - Don't ignore errors you discover while working
- **Natural language explanations** - Never mention tool names, just say what you're doing in plain English

## CODE QUALITY RULES
1. ALWAYS verify changes don't break existing functionality - run tests/linting after every modification
2. NO `any` types without explicit justification - use proper TypeScript interfaces
3. Remove ALL unused imports, variables, and dead code immediately
4. Fix ALL linting errors and warnings before considering work complete
5. Use modern tooling and stay current with best practices

## WORKFLOW STANDARDS
6. Use systematic todo management for complex tasks with status tracking
7. Break large problems into manageable, sequential phases
8. Always use parallel tool calls when possible for efficiency
9. Provide natural language explanations, not technical jargon
10. Document rationale for architectural decisions

## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL - CRITICAL
11. After ANY code change, immediately verify with appropriate tools (lint, test, build)
12. Never assume changes work - always validate
13. Fix cascading issues immediately, don't defer
14. Maintain zero-tolerance for technical debt accumulation
15. **NEVER claim something works without actually testing it**
16. **ALWAYS run the application and verify fixes before reporting success**
17. **Test ALL claimed fixes in the actual running application**
18. **If you say "this should fix X", immediately verify that X is actually fixed**

## COMMUNICATION STANDARDS
19. Explain what tools are doing in natural language
20. Provide progress updates and status summaries
21. Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
22. Hold to professional standards even under time pressure
23. **Never report success without verification**
24. **ALWAYS use concise, shorter commit messages - avoid overly long descriptions**

## BRAINSTORM MODE RULE
25. When Juan starts a chat with "brainstorm" - ONLY provide ideas and suggestions, DO NOT implement anything
26. In brainstorm mode: analyze, suggest, recommend, but never execute code changes or use implementation tools

## DEPENDENCY & ENVIRONMENT AWARENESS - CRITICAL RULES
27. BEFORE writing ANY code that uses external services, databases, or APIs - FIRST verify they are installed and configured
28. NEVER build applications without first checking and setting up ALL required dependencies
29. At the start of ANY development work, create a dependency checklist and verify each item
30. If building database-dependent code, verify database is installed, running, and accessible BEFORE writing a single line
31. If using caching, message queues, or external services, verify they exist and are configured FIRST
32. Always provide setup instructions and dependency lists when creating new projects
33. Test the complete infrastructure stack before implementing business logic
34. It is EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL to write applications without ensuring the infrastructure exists

## IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION - NEW CRITICAL RULES
35. **MANDATORY: After claiming any fix or improvement, immediately test it in the running application**
36. **NEVER say "this should work" or "this fixes X" without actually verifying it works**
37. **When reviewing code for correctness, actually run and test the code, don't just read it**
38. **If warnings/errors persist after claimed fixes, immediately acknowledge and fix them**
39. **Always check browser console, terminal output, and application behavior after changes**
40. **Professional integrity requires verification of all claims before reporting to the user**
