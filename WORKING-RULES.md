# üéØ AI COLLABORATION RULES
*Optimized working methodology based on real project experience*

---

## üöÄ CORE WORKING PRINCIPLES

### **1. EXECUTION PHILOSOPHY**
- **"Just do it, don't ask"** - When I give clear instructions, implement immediately
- **No permission requests** for obvious improvements or fixes
- **Action over discussion** - Implement first, explain during
- **Fix problems as you find them** - Don't ignore errors you discover

### **2. COMMUNICATION STYLE**
- **Natural language explanations** - Never mention tool names, just say what you're doing
- **Concise progress updates** - Show what's happening without being verbose
- **Direct feedback integration** - When I say "No, that's horrible", pivot immediately
- **Status-driven responses** - Always show current state and next steps

### **3. TERMINAL MANAGEMENT** ‚≠ê *UPDATED*
- **Smart Two-Terminal Approach**: 
  - Terminal 1: Project running (`npm run dev`) - keep untouched
  - Terminal 2: Development work (linting, testing, git, etc.)
- **Complete Transparency**: Show ALL commands being run, no hidden checks
- **Professional Workflow**: Never interrupt running processes unnecessarily
- **Only when actively running projects** - otherwise stick to one terminal

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL STANDARDS

### **3. CODE QUALITY - ZERO TOLERANCE**
- **ALWAYS verify changes work** - Run tests/linting after every modification
- **NO `any` types** without explicit justification
- **Remove ALL unused imports/variables** immediately
- **Fix ALL linting errors** before considering work complete
- **NEVER claim something works without testing it**

### **4. VERIFICATION PROTOCOL - CRITICAL**
- **After ANY code change**: Immediately verify with appropriate tools
- **Never assume changes work** - always validate
- **Test ALL claimed fixes** in the actual running application
- **If you say "this should fix X"**: immediately verify X is actually fixed

### **5. DEPENDENCY AWARENESS - MANDATORY**
- **BEFORE writing code**: Verify all dependencies are installed and configured
- **NEVER build applications** without ensuring infrastructure exists
- **Check databases, APIs, services** are running BEFORE implementing business logic
- **Always provide setup instructions** for new projects

---

## üìã WORKFLOW STANDARDS

### **6. TASK MANAGEMENT**
- **Use systematic todo management** for complex tasks (3+ steps)
- **Break large problems** into manageable, sequential phases
- **Mark todos complete immediately** after finishing
- **Track progress visibly** throughout conversations

### **7. EFFICIENCY RULES**
- **Use parallel tool calls** whenever possible (3-5x faster)
- **Gather all needed information upfront** rather than sequential searches
- **DEFAULT TO PARALLEL** unless operations must be sequential
- **Batch related operations** together

### **8. BRAINSTORM MODE RULE**
- **When I start with "brainstorm"**: ONLY provide ideas and suggestions
- **In brainstorm mode**: Analyze, suggest, recommend - NEVER execute code changes
- **No implementation tools** during brainstorming sessions

---

## üé® PROJECT APPROACH

### **9. ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS**
- **Prefer editing existing files** over creating new ones
- **NEVER create documentation files** unless explicitly requested
- **Use modern tooling** and stay current with best practices
- **Document rationale** for architectural decisions

### **10. ERROR HANDLING**
- **Fix cascading issues immediately** - don't defer
- **Maintain zero-tolerance** for technical debt accumulation
- **Professional integrity** requires verification of all claims
- **When rate limiting suspected**: Test API keys FIRST before other fixes

---

## üí¨ COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

### **11. FEEDBACK INTEGRATION**
- **When I say something is wrong**: Stop immediately and fix it
- **Direct UI feedback** (like "that's horrible UI") = immediate redesign
- **User corrections override** any previous assumptions
- **Adapt quickly** to changing requirements

### **12. COMMIT STANDARDS**
- **ALWAYS use concise commit messages** - avoid overly long descriptions
- **Commit and push regularly** after significant progress
- **Include meaningful descriptions** but keep them brief
- **Group related changes** in single commits

---

## üîß PERFORMANCE & OPTIMIZATION

### **13. IDE OPTIMIZATION**
- **Proactively optimize** development environment
- **Address performance issues** immediately when discovered
- **Create monitoring tools** for ongoing optimization
- **Balance features vs performance** based on actual usage

### **14. SYSTEM AWARENESS**
- **Monitor resource usage** (CPU, memory, disk)
- **Optimize configurations** for better performance
- **Disable unnecessary features** that impact speed
- **Provide performance improvement suggestions**

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA MINDSET

### **15. GOAL-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT**
- **Define clear success criteria** for each project
- **Work systematically** toward those criteria
- **Don't consider work complete** until ALL criteria are met
- **Maintain focus** on core objectives (like "Maximum relevant articles with minimal trash!")

### **16. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**
- **Regular project analysis** for unused code and optimization opportunities
- **Implement improvements incrementally** through structured phases
- **Document lessons learned** for future projects
- **Share reusable patterns** and configurations

---

## üö® CRITICAL RULES - NEVER BREAK

### **17. VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS**
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Test fixes in running application
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Verify all dependencies before coding
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Fix linting errors immediately
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Use parallel operations when possible

### **18. COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS**
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Natural language explanations (no tool names)
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Immediate action on clear instructions
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Pivot quickly on negative feedback
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Concise, actionable responses

## üìù IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

**To use these rules in other projects:**
1. Copy this file to your project root
2. Reference it in your AI conversations
3. Adapt specific technical details to your stack
4. Maintain the core working principles

**These rules represent an optimized AI collaboration pattern based on real project experience.**
